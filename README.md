## Project description:

The goal of this project was to Prevent users from adding the same goal more than once.

## Technologies Used:

-Javascript
-DOM munipulation techniques

## Steps followed:

1. First retrieve all the existing goals in the `goalList` using `querySelectorAll`.
2. Then, iterate through each existing goal and compare its text content with the new goal input.
3. If a duplicate is found,display an alert message and exit the function using `return` to prevent the duplicate goal from being added.
4. If no duplicate is found,proceed to create and add the new goal as before.
